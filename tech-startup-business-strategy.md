# Tech Startup Business Strategy

## Appraisal

### Cost 

The primary causes of failure are:

1. Not knowing the cost
2. Being unable or unwilling to pay the cost

* If you don't know the cost, either learn the cost or find a new goal
* If you are unwilling or unable to pay the cost, find a new goal

### Value

* Beyond standard failure and into the realm of success, there is another form of failure: overvaluing a goal
* A venture can effectively fail if success is overvalued to the point that the cost exceeds the benefit
* Business, and most of life, is about appraisalâ€”it is knowing the value of a thing

### Application

Before setting out on a venture:

1. Learn the value
2. Learn the cost
3. Weigh the value and the cost

## Vision

### Vision and Strategy

* Vision is sometimes confused with strategy
* Vision is where you want to go
* Strategy is how you get there
* Vision is easier than strategy
* It is easy to have a grand vision
* It is easy to have an ideal vision
* It is easy for a visionary to have confidence in a vision and neglect strategy
* Competition takes place largely on the planes of strategy, design, and execution, not vision
* Vision is only a competitive edge when only one entity is pursuing that vision
  * In most cases that lack of competition is due to the vision being impractical

## Design

### Product Features

* The first version of a product (V1) needs to be an MVP (Minimally Viable Product)

* A 100-feature MVP that is useless as long as it only has 99 of those features is a bad product

* A good system is one that is useful when it it small and can seamlessly grow larger

* Often a visionary will have a product idea that goes something like this:

* > My boxer is the best boxer in the world!  He can beat anyone in the ring!  All he needs is a club.  And maybe a gun.  And the opponent needs his hands tied behind his back.  With just those features, my boxer can beat anyone!

* A good product idea is one that is useful with relatively few features

* A premature focus on supporting features is often a sign of a bad foundation

* Adding a non-essential feature to a release will not make that feature arrive sooner, it will delay the essential features

## Execution

### Support and Maintenance

* Things need maintenance or they decay
* Things needs support or their use will be limited
* It is easy to underestimate support and maintenance cost
* Especially in the technology industry, it is easy to think, "I will create a thing, and then walk away from that thing, and it will continue to operate and be useful independent of anyone."
  * That thinking is a fallacy
* Occasionally technologies do get a good run without maintenance, but that is the exception, not the norm, and requires both exceptional circumstances and exceptional craftsmanship
  * Even with a good run, such a technology's days are numbered without maintenance
  * Even if a technology can get by for a time without maintenance, without support that technology will not be used beyond the scope of its initial deployment
* Support and maintenance are two of the primary battlegrounds upon which tech companies compete
* If a tech startup is not viewing support and maintenance as two of its primary battlegrounds, it will fail

### Technology

* It is a natural weakness of technology companies to put too much weight on technology
* Even though technology is its product, at heart a tech company is a business
* A tech company does not live and die by its technology, but by its business
* If a tech company has excellent technology and poor business, it will fail
* If a tech company excels in business, tech excellence will follow

### Team Building

* Some say, "The leaders of a tech company need to be excellent with technology"
* Being good at business involves being a good employer
* Being a good employer involves being good at hiring people that are excellent in domains that the employer is not excellent in
* A leader needs trustworthy experts, and needs to trust those experts
* A business can have a great strategy and a great team, but having a single critical role placed in the hands of a a single bad team member can ruin the venture
