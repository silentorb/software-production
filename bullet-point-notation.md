# Bullet Point Notation (BPN)

## Rules

* Avoid paragraphs
* Instead use bullet point lists for arranging information
* Bullet point lists can be nested in 1-4 layers of nested headings
* Lists can be nested within other lists
* Items with only a single sentence should not have end-of-sentence punctuation unless the item is a question
* Items with multiple sentences should have end-of-sentence punctuation
* Minimize using multiple sentences in a single item
  * Most cases of needing multiple sentences in a single item can instead be split into sybling or nested items
* Each item should be useful by itself, indepent of its surrounding points
  * The one exception to this is child items generally depend on their parent items and may not make sense apart from their parent

## Motivation

* Complexity is just a bunch of simple
* Any complex idea is best managed and communicated when it is divided into smaller ideas, all the way down to atomic ideas
* Within a document, an atomic idea is an idea that is useful by itself
* Traditional paragraph structure puts too much weight on sentences depending on previous sentences
  * To some degree document information does have a natural sequential flow
    * Paragraphs over-emphasize sequence
* Paragraphs raise secondary issues such as being awkward with a single sentence
  * Thus the creation of rules where a paragraph needs at least five sentences
    * Most of information architecture does not need
* Ideally, a document is composed of atomic, independent ideas that are useful by themselves and even more useful when read in sequence
* When information is broken into atomic bullet point items, end-of-sentence punction is no longer
* The hierarchical nature of nested lists cleanly organizes information along the spectrum of general to specific data
  * Parent lists are more general while child lists are more specific
  * This structure adds flexibility to documents
    *  A high level list can initially be created with room to add more specific details under each general item
  * This structure makes documents easier for readers to scan and absorb
